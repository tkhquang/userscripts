# Iflix Subtitles Fix for Firefox 59-60
A userscript for Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey

Iflix seems to have problems with Firefox, this is just a fix for a small issue that I've encountered. Without the script, font size for subtitles is just too small, thus making it hardly readable.

Script was written and tested on Tampermonkey v4.6.5757. If you have issues running this script, you should visit [this link](https://github.com/tkhquang/userscripts/issues/new) and submit new issue, thank you.
