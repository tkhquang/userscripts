# Iflix Subtitles Fix for Firefox 59
An userscript for Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey/Greasemonkey

Iflix seems to have problems with Firefox, this is just a fix for a small stuff that I've encounterd. Without the script, subtitles text sizes are just too small, making it hardly readable.

Script was written and tested on Tampermonkey v4.6.5757. If you have issues running this script, you should visit [this link](https://github.com/tkhquang/userscripts/issues/new) and submit new issue, thank you.
