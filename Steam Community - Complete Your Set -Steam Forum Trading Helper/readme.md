## INTRODUCTION

This was a small script I made for myself in order to make new trade threads easily and to compare which cards I own and which I don't with other existing threads.

*Why did I make it?* Sometimes Steam Trade Matcher couldn't help me complete some sets. I had to use the Trading Forum to find the cards I wanted. The original idea of this script was to list all the cards I've owned and have yet to own to complete a full set. Because when I navigate to the Trading Forum, I can't seem to remember which cards I'm looking for and which are the duplicated ones that I can trade off. Having to switching between tabs is so inconvenient and tedious, so I made this script to list the Name and the #Number of the card in the Series to the input field of the New Trade Thread. Then I extended it a little bit to make the creating of new Trading Thread easier and also plus some other features.

## FEATURES

1. Get Owned-Card-List and Unowned-Card-List
2. Can check the missing cards to complete the set
3. Automatically create and have it auto filled in the input areas in New Trading Thread arcoding to your config in the script

## INSTRUCTIONS

 1. Download and install Tampermonkey for your browser
 2. Download the script
 3. Press install when asked
 4. (Optional) Configure your preferred settings in the script code
 5. Go to the Game Card Page, if the script functions correctly then you will see a "Visit Trading Forum" button next to the "View cards in my Inventory" and "Sell these cards on the Market" within seconds. According to the default config, if you go to a Game Card Page that you don't have enough cards to have a full set, the button won't appear. However, if you open the browser console (Pressing F12 if you're on Firefox), on 'console' tab with 'logs' filtered, if you see this line: "Number of cards you've owned: x", then you can tell that the script is running correctly.
 6. Enjoy!
